# FAST PWA

FAST PWA is a starter template to create a PWA using [FAST](https://github.com/microsoft/fast) router, FAST based [Fluent](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui) web components and is based on PWABuilder's [pwa-starter](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter).

This is an informal project and will include various sample interactions to demonstrate various aspects of FAST and PWA capabilities.  Could be whimsical.

Still in early stages, more to come.
