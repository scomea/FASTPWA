# FAST PWA

FAST PWA is a starter template to create a PWA using [FAST](https://github.com/microsoft/fast) router, FAST based [Fluent](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui) web components and is based on PWABuilder's [pwa-starter](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter).

Still in early stages, more to come.
